   <p align="justify"> Bungee jumping in Nepal is one of the most thrilling adventure experiences the country has to offer. Set against the breathtaking backdrop of the Himalayas, Nepal's bungee jumping spots provide not just an adrenaline rush, but also stunning natural scenery. One of the most famous locations is the Bhote Koshi River Gorge, near the Nepal-Tibet border, where jumpers plunge from a suspension bridge 160 meters above the river—a drop that ranks among the highest in the world. The jump is operated by professional teams with international safety standards, making it both an exciting and safe adventure for thrill-seekers. In recent years, additional sites like Pokhara’s Hemja bungee jump, overlooking green hills and rivers, have added to Nepal’s reputation as a top destination for extreme sports. Bungee jumping here is more than just a leap—it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience combining fear, freedom, and stunning Himalayan beauty.</p><br>
