   <p align="justify"> Ultra-flight aircraft, also known as ultralight flights, offer a thrilling and unforgettable way to experience Nepal’s natural beauty from the sky. Most popular in Pokhara, these small, open-cockpit aircraft typically carry one passenger and a pilot, soaring above stunning landscapes like Phewa Lake, lush valleys, and traditional villages, with the majestic Annapurna and Machhapuchhre (Fishtail) mountains in clear view. Unlike other aerial adventures, ultra-flights provide an incredibly personal and panoramic experience, giving travelers a sense of truly flying in the open air. Flights range from 15 minutes to over an hour, with longer trips taking you closer to the Himalayas and even near the skies above Annapurna Base Camp. Operated by experienced pilots and designed for both comfort and safety, ultra-flights are accessible to most travelers and best enjoyed during the clear seasons between September and May. For those seeking a unique perspective of Nepal’s breathtaking terrain, this is an adventure not to be missed.</p><br>
