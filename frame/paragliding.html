   <p align="justify"> Paragliding is an exciting adventure sport that allows individuals to fly through the sky using a lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft. With no engine, the paraglider soars by catching thermals (rising air currents), giving pilots a birdâ€™s-eye view of the landscape below. It offers a unique mix of thrill, freedom, and tranquility, making it one of the most popular aerial sports worldwide.
    In tandem paragliding, a professional pilot controls the glider while the passenger enjoys the flight, making it accessible even to beginners. Paragliding can last anywhere from 15 minutes to over an hour depending on weather conditions and location. Ideal spots usually feature hills or mountains with good wind currents, making Nepal, especially Pokhara, a top destination due to its stable weather, dramatic scenery, and experienced pilots. Whether for leisure, sport, or just to enjoy the breathtaking view, paragliding is a truly unforgettable experience.</p><br>
