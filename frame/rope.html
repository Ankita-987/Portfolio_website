   <p align="justify"> Rope cycling, also known as sky cycling, is an emerging adventure activity in Nepal that offers a thrilling blend of excitement and breathtaking views. Suspended high above the ground on a tightly secured cable, riders pedal across a narrow track stretched between hills or platforms, often overlooking deep valleys, forests, or mountain backdrops. Popular destinations for rope cycling in Nepal include Kalinchowk Adventure Park in Dolakha, where cyclists are treated to stunning views of snow-covered peaks, and Kanyam in Ilam, known for its lush tea gardens and serene landscapes. Pokhara, already a hub for adventure seekers, also features rope cycling in some of its resorts and activity parks, combining the experience with panoramic views of the Annapurna range and Phewa Lake. With proper safety gear and harnesses, rope cycling is designed to be both safe and exhilarating, making it a must-try for travelers looking to add a unique and heart-pounding twist to their Nepal adventure.</p>
