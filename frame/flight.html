    Flights in Nepal play a crucial role in both transportation and tourism, offering travelers access to 
    remote regions and breathtaking views of the Himalayas. Due to the country’s mountainous terrain and 
    limited road infrastructure, domestic flights are often the most efficient way to travel between cities 
    and rural destinations. Popular flight routes include Kathmandu to Pokhara, Kathmandu to Lukla (
    the gateway to Everest Base Camp), and Pokhara to Jomsom, among others. These short flights 
    are not only time-saving but also provide an exhilarating experience, as small aircraft soar 
    above lush valleys, terraced hillsides, and towering peaks. For tourists venturing into high-altitude 
    trekking areas like the Everest or Annapurna regions, flights are essential in cutting down travel time
    and avoiding rough road journeys.</p>

    In addition to domestic travel, Nepal also offers spectacular mountain flights that cater specifically 
    to tourists seeking a closer view of the Himalayas without trekking. These scenic flights, usually departing
    from Kathmandu, offer stunning panoramic views of some of the world’s highest peaks, including Mount Everest,
    Lhotse, and Makalu. Another luxurious option is a helicopter tour, which provides a private, up-close aerial
    adventure and even allows landings at iconic spots like Everest Base Camp, Gosaikunda Lake, or Annapurna Base Camp.
    These flight experiences combine convenience with unforgettable scenery, making them a must-try for adventure
    lovers and nature enthusiasts visiting Nepal.</p>

        Talcha Airport, also known as Rara Airport, is a small but significant domestic airport located in the Mugu District
         of Nepal. Situated at an elevation of approximately 2,735 meters (8,970 feet) above sea level, it serves as the primary
          gateway to Rara National Park and Rara Lake, one of Nepal's most stunning natural landmarks. The airport has a 570-meter
           long asphalt runway, which is considered short for the terrain and challenging weather conditions. Tara Air is the main
           airline operating flights to Talcha, connecting the airport with Nepalgunj in western Nepal. The airport's location in 
           the mountainous region makes it one of the more hazardous airports in Nepal, requiring pilots to have specialized training.
            Flights are mostly scheduled during daylight hours due to the difficult flying conditions. </p>

                    Jomsom Airport (IATA: JMO, ICAO: VNJS) is located in the town of Jomsom, Mustang District, at an elevation of about 2,700 meters 
                    (8,858 feet) in central Nepal. It serves as a crucial gateway to the Mustang region, providing access to destinations like Kagbeni,
                     Tangbe, Lo Manthang, and the Muktinath temple, a sacred site for both Hindus and Buddhists. The airport has a relatively short
                      1,000-meter asphalt runway, making it challenging for aircraft, especially in the mountainous terrain surrounded by the Annapurna
                       and Dhaulagiri mountain ranges. Small aircraft like the Twin Otter and Dornier 228 are typically used for flights to and from 
                       Pokhara, as they are well-suited for such conditions.</p>

                        Dolpa Airport, also known as Juphal Airport, is a small domestic airport located in Juphal, Thuli Bheri Municipality, serving the 
                        remote Dolpa District in Nepal’s Karnali Province. Established in 1978 and inaugurated by King Birendra, the airport sits at an
                         elevation of about 2,499 meters (8,200 feet) above sea level. It has a 663-meter-long asphalt runway, which was upgraded from 
                         gravel in 2017 to improve safety. Surrounded by rugged mountains, the airport is considered one of the more challenging and 
                         weather-sensitive airports in the country. Despite its remote location, Dolpa Airport is a crucial gateway to attractions
                          like Shey Phoksundo National Park and Phoksundo Lake, the deepest lake in Nepal. With limited road access in the region, the 
                          airport provides essential connectivity for both locals and tourists. </p>
