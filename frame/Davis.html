   <p align="justify">  Also known as "Patale Chhango," Davis Falls is a unique waterfall where the river suddenly plunges into a deep underground tunnel. The waterfall got its name after a tragic incident involving a Swiss tourist in the 1960s, giving it a mix of natural wonder and local legend. The force of the water, especially during the monsoon season, is both mesmerizing and powerful. A nearby cave, Gupteshwor Mahadev, lies directly beneath the falls and offers an adventurous descent into the underground world, complete with a hidden view of the waterfall from below.
