   <p align="justify">  Set along the banks of the sacred Bagmati River, Pashupatinath is one of the holiest Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Shiva, attracting thousands of pilgrims and sadhus from Nepal and India. Though non-Hindus are not allowed inside the main temple, the surrounding complex is rich with shrines, sculptures, and rituals. One of the most striking and profound experiences is witnessing the traditional open-air cremation ceremonies along the riverbanks, offering insight into Nepalese spiritual practices and beliefs about the cycle of life and death.</p><br>
