    For those venturing into trekking regions such as the Everest, Annapurna, or Langtang areas, cozy teahouses and lodges
    are available along the trails. These provide basic yet welcoming facilities, warm meals, and a chance to interact
    with local families and fellow trekkers. In more remote areas, community homestays have also become popular, giving
    visitors an authentic taste of village life. No matter the budget or travel style, Nepal’s hospitality is known for
    being warm, friendly, and genuine—making your stay not just comfortable, but memorable.
