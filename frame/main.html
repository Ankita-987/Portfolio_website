    </h3>
        <p align="justify"><img src="./image/download.jfif" alt="11" align="left" width="170" height="140"> Nepal is renowned for its heartfelt hospitality, with the cultural principle of "Atithi Devo Bhava" (the guest is God) at its core. Tourists are warmly greeted with a "Namaste," often accompanied by flower garlands, and welcomed into homes for tea or snacks. Whether trekking in the Himalayas or visiting rural villages, locals go out of their way to make visitors feel like family, offering not just services but genuine kindness. Cultural immersion, such as participating in local ceremonies or staying with families through homestays, deepens these connections. The generosity and care Nepalese people show to tourists leave lasting impressions, making every visit feel personal and special.
