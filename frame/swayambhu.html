   <p align="justify">  Located atop a forested hill overlooking the Kathmandu Valley, Swayambhunath is one of Nepal's most sacred Buddhist sites, revered by both Buddhists and Hindus. With its white dome, gilded spire, and the watchful eyes of the Buddha painted on all four sides, the stupa exudes spiritual energy. Surrounded by smaller shrines, colorful prayer flags, and countless monkeys, the site offers a peaceful yet vibrant atmosphere. A climb up the 365 stone steps to the top rewards visitors with panoramic views of the city and a deep sense of calm and reflection.
