   <p align="justify"> Skydiving in Nepal is one of the most thrilling and scenic aerial adventures in the world, offering a rare blend of extreme sport and jaw-dropping natural beauty. The two main spots for skydiving are Everest Region and Pokhara, each providing a unique experience. The Everest Skydive is truly legendary—considered one of the highest commercial skydives on Earth. You jump from a height of up to 23,000 feet, freefalling near Mount Everest itself, with a landing either at Syangboche (12,350 ft) or Amadablam Base Camp, depending on the drop zone. This isn’t just an adrenaline rush; it’s a visual spectacle of snow-covered peaks, deep valleys, and rugged Himalayan terrain.
    In contrast, Pokhara Skydive is slightly lower in altitude but equally breathtaking. You jump from around 13,000 feet above the beautiful Pokhara Valley, with panoramic views of the Annapurna Range, Fishtail (Machhapuchhre), and Phewa Lake. It's more accessible, making it ideal for first-timers or those looking for a mix of thrill and natural beauty without the extreme altitude.
     Both experiences are conducted by professional international teams with strict safety protocols, tandem jumps with certified instructors, and pre-jump training. Skydiving in Nepal is typically offered in spring (April-May) and autumn (October-November), when the weather is stable and the skies are clear—perfect for both visibility and safety. Whether you're an adrenaline junkie or a travel enthusiast seeking the ultimate high-altitude adventure, skydiving in Nepal delivers an unforgettable, heart-pounding encounter with the Himalayas.</p>
