   <p align="justify"> Located just across from Davis Falls, Gupteshwor Mahadev is one of the longest caves in Nepal and holds deep religious significance. The cave houses a sacred Shiva lingam and features winding paths, limestone formations, and natural underground beauty. As visitors move deeper into the cave, they encounter the roaring sound of Davis Falls from withinâ€”creating a mystical and immersive experience. Dimly lit and slightly humid, the cave adventure adds an element of exploration to the spiritual journey, making it a favorite among both pilgrims and curious travelers.</p><br>
