   <p align="justify"> Zip flying in Nepal is one of the most adrenaline-pumping adventure activities, offering an electrifying blend of speed, height, and scenic beauty. The most iconic zip line in Nepal is located in Sarangkot, Pokhara, and it's one of the steepest, longest, and fastest zip lines in the world. With a vertical drop of around 600 meters, a length of over 1.8 kilometers, and speeds reaching up to 140 km/h, it's an experience that takes your breath away—literally and figuratively.

    The ride begins high above the Pokhara Valley, with spectacular views of the Annapurna range, Machhapuchhre (Fishtail Mountain), and Phewa Lake. As you launch from the hilltop platform, you're harnessed safely into a seated position, letting you fly hands-free through the air like a superhero. Zip flying is open to all adventure lovers and is managed with top-tier international safety standards. It's not just a thrill ride—it's a high-speed journey through one of the most beautiful landscapes on Earth, making it a must-do for adrenaline seekers visiting Nepal.</p>
