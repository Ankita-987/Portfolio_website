   <p align="justify">  A cultural gem in the heart of the old city, Kathmandu Durbar Square is a historical complex filled with palaces, courtyards, and ancient temples that reflect the artistic and architectural glory of the Malla era. Though some structures were damaged in the 2015 earthquake, the square still retains its charm with landmarks like the Taleju Temple, Kumari Ghar (home of the Living Goddess), and Hanuman Dhoka Palace. Wandering through the square feels like stepping back in time, where every stone and carving tells a story of Nepalâ€™s regal and religious past.</p><br>
