   <p align="justify">  Located at the base of Shivapuri Hill, around 10 kilometers north of central Kathmandu, Budhanilkantha Temple is one of the most revered and visually striking Hindu pilgrimage sites in Nepal. The temple is renowned for its massive statue of Lord Vishnu, depicted in a reclining position on a bed of stone serpents, floating peacefully in a sacred pond. This awe-inspiring figure, carved from a single block of black basalt, measures over five meters long and represents Vishnu resting in the cosmic ocean. The site holds deep spiritual significance, especially for devotees of Vishnu, and it attracts pilgrims throughout the year, with an even greater influx during special occasions like Haribodhini Ekadashi. While non-Hindus are not permitted to touch the statue, visitors are welcome to admire it from a respectful distance and take in the tranquil, devotional ambiance of the open-air shrine. Surrounded by greenery and serene mountain views, Budhanilkantha offers a quiet retreat from the busy city, blending natural beauty with sacred legend.</p><br>
