   <p align="justify">  Towering over the surrounding rooftops in the northeast of Kathmandu,
     Boudhanath is one of the largest and most significant stupas in the world. This UNESCO 
     World Heritage Site is a spiritual heart for Tibetan Buddhists, many of whom have settled
      in the area. The massive white dome and golden spire are surrounded by a circular path
       lined with prayer wheels and monasteries, where devotees perform kora (ritual circumambulation)
        day and night. The area is filled with the scent of incense and the sound of chanting,
         making it a tranquil escape from the city's hustle and bustle.
